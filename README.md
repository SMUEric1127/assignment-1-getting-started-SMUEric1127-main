# Assignment 1: Getting Started

## 1. Software

Install the needed software and make yourself familiar with it.

### GitHub

1. If you do not have an account, then create one at https://github.com/
2. Work through the [GitHub's quickstart section](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart)

### Visual Studio Code

Install the [required tools](https://github.com/mhahsler/CS2341#required-tools)
 
More documentation can be found in the Setup and C++ sections at https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/

## 2. Data Structures Countdown Program

To make sure that everything works, edit `main.cpp` so it prints a count down from 9 to 1 (using a loop) and then says "It is time for data structures."

Use CMake and choose GCC 11 (g++ or CLANG) for compilation (see [HOWTOs](https://github.com/mhahsler/CS2341/blob/main/Chapter1_Programming/HOWTOs.md) for help). 

Replace the file `output.png` with a screenshot of your program's output (see [PNG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics)).

## 3. Get Familiar With Markdown

This document uses [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/). Read up on the basic [syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

GitHub automatically renders markdown documents ending in `.md`.

You can preview the rendered document in VS Code by right-clicking the file and choosing `Open Preview`.
